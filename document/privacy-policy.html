        </p><h2>Sharing of Personal Information</h2>
        <p>We do not sell, rent, share, or disclose Personal Information to third parties, except as provided
            herein.</p>
        <h2>Aggregate Information</h2>
        <p>Personal Information does not include &quot;aggregate&quot; information. Aggregate information is data we
            collect about a group or category of services or users, from which individual customer identities have been
            removed. In other words, information about how you use a service, or the results of such use, may be
            collected and combined with similar information others, but no Personal Information will be included in the
            resulting data. We can extract statistical data from your content in order to provide other users or
            partners without connecting it to any personal data such as name or e-mail address.</p>
        <p>Aggregate data helps us understand trends and user needs so that we can better consider new products and
            services, and tailor existing products and services to customer desires. You understand that we may
            commercialize aggregate information by any and all means, and that you will receive no payment or other
            consideration in respect of such use.</p>
        <h2>Third party tracking</h2>
        <p>We use third party tracking tools like Mixpanel. If you wish to opt-out from our third party services, please
            email us at hello@repost.com.</p>
        <h2>Other Disclosures and Transfer of your Information</h2>
        <p>In addition, we may disclose Personal Information in the good faith belief that we are required to do so by
            law, or that doing so is reasonably necessary to comply with laws or legal process, respond to any claims,
            or to protect the rights, property, or personal safety of us, our customers, or the public. We will fully
            cooperate with any law enforcement authorities or court order requesting or directing us to disclose the
            identity, behavior or digital content of any user suspected to have engaged in illegal or infringing
            behavior.</p>
        <p>We may provide Personal Information to third party vendors or service providers who assist us or our
            affiliates in administering and managing our sites, products, services or business (such as third parties
            providing hosting services). These recipients of Personal Information are not authorized to use the
            information we share with them for any other purpose. By providing such information, you expressly consent
            to such transfer and use, including transfers outside of the jurisdiction in which the information was
            provided.</p>
        <p>Information about our customers, including Personal Information, may be disclosed as part of, or during
            negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets or capital stock, merger, reorganization, dissolution or
            similar event. By providing such information, you expressly consent to such transfer and use, including
            transfers outside of the jurisdiction in which the information was provided.</p>
        <h2>Protection of Personal Information</h2>
        <p>We have put into place security measures in an effort to protect Personal Information from loss, misuse or
            alteration while it is under our control. We use technical, contractual, administrative and physical
            measures in an effort to protect against unauthorized access. These include secured servers. Although we
            take measures we believe are appropriate to safeguard against unauthorized disclosures of Personal
            Information, &quot;perfect security&quot; does not exist on the Internet. We cannot ensure or warrant the
            security of any Personal Information you transmit to us, and you transmit such information at your own
            risk.</p>
        <h2>How Long Do We Retain Your Personal Information</h2>
        <p>Upon usage of the Service, we may retain your Personal information for a commercially reasonable period of
            time for backup, archival, or audit purposes.</p>
        <h2>Choice</h2>
        <p>If at any time you wish to stop receiving promotional information from the Service, you may opt out by
            e-mailing us at hello@repostplus.com.</p>
        <h2>Use of the Service by Children</h2>

            you become aware that somebody under the age of 13 has enrolled without parental permission, please inform
            us immediately.</p>
        <h2>Online Links to Other Sites</h2>
        <p>If any part of the Service links you to websites, enables the download of third party software, or integrates
            third party software, those websites, software or related services are not subject to this Privacy Policy.
            Any Personal Information you provide on the linked pages is provided directly to this third-party and is
            subject to that third party&#x27;s provider&#x27;s privacy policy.</p>
        <p>Except as described above, we are not responsible for the content or privacy practices of websites to which
            we link. Links from our site to third parties or other websites are provided for your convenience. We
            encourage you to learn about the privacy practices of each web site before providing them with Personal
            Information.</p>

        <p>We reserve the right to change this privacy statement at any time, but will alert you that changes have been
            made by indicating the date it was last updated. We encourage you to review our privacy statement to make
